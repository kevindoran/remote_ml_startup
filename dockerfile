# Every thing seems to work a lot easier if we explicitly create a non-root 
# user. This follows the advice from: https://vsupalov.com/docker-shared-permissions/
# Creating the user made running Jupiter Lab work.
# Creating a new (non-root) user makes a lot of things easier:
# - there will be a home directory with user permissions
# - no need to manually create a directory to work from
# - avoid the "no username" being displayed when using iterative mode.
